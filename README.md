# Ghost on Alpine Linux

[![](https://badge.imagelayers.io/zzrot/alpine-ghost:latest.svg)](https://imagelayers.io/?images=zzrot/alpine-ghost:latest 'Get your own badge on imagelayers.io') [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ZZROTDesign/alpine-ghost.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ZZROTDesign/alpine-ghost) [![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/zzrot/alpine-ghost.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://hub.docker.com/r/zzrot/alpine-ghost/)

This is a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image for [Ghost](https://ghost.org). This image runs with a base of [Alpine-Linux](http://www.alpinelinux.org/) making it extremely small, secure and fast.

This image is also available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/zzrot/alpine-ghost/).

## Usage
We recommend using our images in conjunction with [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). This allows for easier creation of containers with the proper volumes and ports enabled.

We have included an [example docker-compose](https://github.com/ZZROTDesign/alpine-ghost/blob/master/examples/docker-compose.example.yml) file to show how this image might be used both for development and production in a different project.

This image works out of the box with no volumes. It differs from the official Docker Ghost image by including a config.js file with some env variables defined.

1. DEV_DOMAIN = Is the domain that is reachable on your development machine. This is typically your docker-machine host ip
2. PROD_DOMAIN = When running this image in production (NODE_ENV=production), this is the domain that is used.

This image also runs with containers. It will accept a volume from your ghost content folder, as well as a custom config.js file. These must point to /var/lib/ghost/ - See the [example docker-compose](https://github.com/ZZROTDesign/alpine-ghost/blob/master/examples/docker-compose.example.yml) for specification.

## Getting Started

To run this container with the predefined defaults:

    docker run -p 2368:2368 zzrot/alpine-ghost

Now the Ghost container will be available at your.dockermachine.ip:2368.

See the example compose file for specification of including the ENV variables as well as the volumes.

### Volumes

This image has one volume that can be utilized. By connecting a folder with:

     /var/lib/ghost/

You can not only keep your data persistent, but also upload a custom config.js file. In order to do this connect your volume like this:

     /your/contentfolder:/var/lib/ghost/
